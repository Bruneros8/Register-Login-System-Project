# Register-Login System Project

This project is a **Python-based register and login system**, created using the guide provided by [Coddy.tech](https://coddy.tech/courses/register_login_system_project). It allows users to securely register an account and log in using stored credentials. The system demonstrates basic account handling concepts like user authentication and data persistence.

## Features
- **User Registration**: Allows new users to create accounts with secure credential storage.
- **User Login**: Authenticates users using their registered credentials.
- **Data Storage**: Stores user information locally for demonstration purposes.

## File Structure
- **main.py**: Contains the Python code for user registration and login functionality.

## Usage
To run the project:
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the directory containing `main.py`.
3. Run the script using the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py

## Customization
If you'd like to modify the system:
- Update the storage mechanism in `main.py` to use a database (e.g., SQLite, MySQL) instead of local files for better scalability.
- Enhance the user authentication process by integrating password encryption using libraries like `bcrypt` or `hashlib`.
